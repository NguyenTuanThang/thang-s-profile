            I was born in a small village in Hai Duong, Vietnam. After graduating from high school,<br>
            I went to Ho Chi Minh City to study at a university. I have experienced many things here,<br> 
            such as part-time jobs, social activities and joining clubs. For example, I took part in an<br>
            outside bonding with my club which is Taekwondo. We went mountain climbing. That <br>
            day was so memorable to me. We climbed to the top of the mountain for over three hours. <br>
            At that time, we encouraged each other to motivate ourselves for climbing and we did not <br>
            give up. When we were on the top of the mountain, we had smiles on our faces together. <br>
            In my free time, I often play guitar to relax.

        <h3>My story in the IT field</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="story_text">
        <p>
            The first time I have known about information technology by playing a video game, I had<br>
            tried to fix money in the game to make it easy to play. I changed a few pieces of data to<br>
            increase money when I was in high school. Due to this work, I have learned how to write <br>
            and fix data for a game, and it is called coding. Therefore, I pay more attention to coding to <br>
            create a video game, and I hope one day that I will have an interesting game, which I create <br>
            by myself and the game will be common to players. For preparation, I have had basic <br>
            experience with python. Also, I had created several simple games but only I can play those <br>
            games. For example, I used if and else for coding rock paper scissors games. The reason <br>
            why I chose to go to RMIT University for studying was because I researched information <br>
            of the university on websites which relate top 10 universities educated information <br>
            technology well. Also, my father suggested that I study there to have more chances for <br>
            developing myself. In addition, I experienced a course in the university and I felt it was <br>
            good for me for studying and improving my computer skills. I hope that studying in the <br>
            university will help me understand deeply how to use coding languages. Also, I have <br>
            chances to approach tools and equipment in the major during studying.
